_An event system for Jupyter Applications and extensions._

Jupyter Events enables Jupyter Python Applications (e.g. Jupyter Server, JupyterLab Server, JupyterHub, etc.) to emit **events**â€”structured data describing things happening inside the application. Other software (e.g. client applications like JupyterLab) can _listen_ and respond to these events.

## Install

Install Jupyter Events directly from PyPI:

```
pip install jupyter_events
```

or conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_events
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [jupyter-events.readthedocs.io](https://jupyter-events.readthedocs.io).

## About the Jupyter Development Team

The Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.
This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.

## Our Copyright Policy

Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Jupyter repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

```
# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.
# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
```
